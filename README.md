The data set used for this project is the cab_rides.csv data set that examined over 690,000 ride share rides in Boston, MA during November of 2018. The data set itself is too large to include in this repository. However, I have included the .Rmd file as well as the base code used to create the visualizations and regresion model included in the poster. Ultimately, this research project sought to examine the impact of travel distance on rideshare pricing structures and understand more deeply what kinds of factors influence the price of a rideshare ride. The poster was created using the Posterdown Betterland functionality in R.
